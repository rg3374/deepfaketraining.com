# **Manual Deepfake Audio Detection Training using deepfaketraining.net**

## **Training Duration: 45–60 minutes**

## **Audience: Call Center / Customer Support Agents**

## **Training Goal:**

Equip staff to **recognize suspicious audio patterns**, **identify behavioral red flags**, and **follow escalation procedures**.

### MODULE 1 — Why Deepfake Awareness Matters (5 minutes)

Objectives:

* Understand why deepfake audio is used in fraud
* Attackers use synthetic voices to:  
  * Impersonate customers  
  * Pretend to be supervisors or executives  
  * Request password resets or urgent transactions  
* Modern synthetic voices can sound very real

### MODULE 2 — What Deepfake Voices Sound Like (10 minutes)

Play examples from Part 1 · Warmup from deepfaketraining.net. 
Learn to listen for:

### Auditory Red Flags

1. No or unnatural breathing  
2. Perfectly even pace (too smooth)  
3. Flat or emotionless tone  
4. Words run together cleanly (no micro-pauses)  
5. Strange pronunciation or emphasis  
6. Metallic or “hollow” timbre  
7. Repetitive intonation patterns

### **Replay Attack Signs**

* Echoes or re-recording room sounds  
* Abrupt changes in background noise  
* “Speakerphone” quality inconsistencies

### MODULE 3 — Behavioral Warning Signs (10 minutes)

Many modern deepfakes sound realistic, so staff should pay attention to **behavior**, not just audio.

### **Behavioral Red Flags**

1. Caller avoids answering simple personal questions  
2. Keeps repeating the same lines  
3. Ignores questions or responds incorrectly  
4. Shows no emotional change in natural situations  
5. Pushes urgency (“Do this immediately”)  
6. Refuses security verification steps  
7. Suspicious reason for not being able to talk normally

### MODULE 4 — What Agents Should Do in the Moment (5 minutes)

### **1\. Slow Down the Conversation**

Ask clarifying questions. Deepfakes often break.

### **2\. Switch to verification mode**

Use existing ID protocols:

* Knowledge-based questions  
* Multi-factor verification  
* Pre-set customer identifiers

### **3\. Ask unpredictable questions**

This helps detect scripted or synthetic callers. Example:  
 “Before I proceed, can you confirm the last item you purchased?”

### **4\. Maintain a neutral tone**

Never accuse the caller directly.

### **5\. If still suspicious then escalate**

Follow your supervisor or fraud team procedure.

### MODULE 5 — Short Practice Exercise (10–15 minutes)

Play clips (mix of real and synthetic) from Part 1 · Warmup from deepfaketraining.net. 
For each clip, ask participants to identify :

1. Real or synthetic?  
2. Would you escalate this call?

### MODULE 6 — Summary (5 minutes)

### **Three Key Listening Rules**

1. Does the voice sound too perfect?  
2. Is the behavior inconsistent or evasive?  
3. Is something “off” about timing, emotion, or response?

### MODULE 7 — Core Technologies and Software Tools (15 minutes)

Ask participants to complete Part 4 · Deepfake Defense Resources from deepfaketraining.net
